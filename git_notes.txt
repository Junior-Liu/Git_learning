1 Git codes explaination:
    git add <file>
        > type in the name of the file you want to 
            get into the load of submitting;
        > you can use it for multiple times before 
            you launch your submittion
            - one submittion carries multiple files.
        > add multiple files with one add:
            (e.g.
                git add file1.txt file2.txt
                git add file3.txt                   )
    
    git commit -m <message>
        > -m for "message": remark for this committing.
            Writing remarks for your committion helps
            both you and others on painful debugging.
            The message SHOULD be put in "".
            (e.g.
                git commit -m "wrote a readme file" )
        > bash will return situation of the files in 
            the repository: 
            (e.g.
                x file changed, y insertations(+)
                create mode n readme.txt            )
            but detailed changes inside the files are 
            absent.
